# 4-bit ALU in Verilog

This is a simple RTL project of a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) written in Verilog and simulated using EDA Playground.

## ALU Functions:
- `00` → Addition
- `01` → Subtraction
- `10` → Bitwise AND
- `11` → Bitwise OR

## Files:
- `design.sv`: Contains ALU module
- `testbench.sv`: Testbench for simulation

## Simulation Tool:
- [EDA Playground](https://edaplayground.com)
- Simulator: Icarus Verilog 12.0

## Author:
- Nathish Rathod (ECE 3rd Year Student)
